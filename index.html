              <p id="bio-paragraphs">Hello! I am warm, friendly, and energetic.  Lucy is the perfect name for me, because I am a lot like Lucy from the comic strip <em>Peanuts</em>.  Basically, I love listening to other people's problem and telling them what to do.  I am based in Kansas City, Missouri where I live with my dog, Charlie Brown.  He is a beagle like Snoopy.</p>
              <br>
              <p id="bio-paragraphs">I lived in Las Vegas for two years where I taught fourth and second grade.  Out there, I learned that the desert's heat and the teacher's life was not for me.  Most of all, I missed Kansas City with its cloudy days, its changing seasons, and its friendly people.  I decided to move back home, and embark on a new adventure of becoming a full-stack web developer.</p>
              <br>
              <p id="bio-paragraphs">I am a full-stack web developer with experience with HTML, CSS using both Bootstrap and Materialize CSS frameworks, and Javascript and its many libraries.  I graduated from the KU Coding Bootcamp on its Edward Campus in Overland Park, Kansas.  In a previous career, I was a classroom teacher.  When I started most of my students couldn't read or write, I had to develop curriculum and processes with the help of technology to get the majority of my students on grade-level for both reading and writing.  I learned how to think criticially and strategically, how to communicate effectively, and how to lead others with positive reinforcements.  As a web developer, I bring determination and passion to all of my projects in order to continue mastering my web development abilities and skills.</p>
              <br>
              <p id="bio-paragraphs">Most importantly, I would love to get a cup of coffee or tea with you to discuss how we could start a positive change in your personal or professional life with web development and design.  Please contact me either through email lucyq19@gmail.com or phone 816-679-0822.</p>
